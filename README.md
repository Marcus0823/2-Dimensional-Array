# 2-Dimensional-Array
This Java code performs calculations on a two-dimensional array representing sales data for different courses over a quarter. Here's a summary of what the code does:

The code defines a class named TwoDArrayActivity.

The main method is the entry point of the program. It initializes a two-dimensional array numCourses with sales data for different courses.

The loopArray method is called, which calculates the sum of each salesperson's quarterly sales by iterating through the elements of the numCourses array using nested loops. The sum is printed for each salesperson.

The loopArrayAverage method is called, which calculates the average sales for each month by iterating through the elements of the numCourses array using nested loops. The average is printed for each month.

In the loopArray and loopArrayAverage methods, the result variable is used to accumulate the sum, and the average variable is used to accumulate the average.

The printf method is used to format and print the sum and average values with two decimal places.

In summary, this code calculates the sum of quarterly sales for each salesperson and the average sales for each month based on the provided sales data in the numCourses array. The results are printed using formatted output.
